## How to Use

Each ticket follows a **structured template**:
1. **Problem description** – what the user reported  
2. **Environment** – OS, network, software  
3. **Reproduction steps** – how to reproduce the issue  
4. **Diagnostics & troubleshooting** – step-by-step actions taken  
5. **Root cause & solution** – final fix  
6. **Verification & prevention** – confirm resolution and suggest improvements  

This mirrors real ITSM documentation practices.
